# Unlicensed files

This is a Github repository for files for which I (MB) could not find
a license, or get an answer about the license.

For each set of files that appear to be from a particular source, there is
a directory, with its own `README.md`.  That README file records where I found
the files and where I looked for license information.

If you find a file here that you would like me to remove, and where you have
some claim on the file, please let me know:
